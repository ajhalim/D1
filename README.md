To meet all the requirements our slideshow, we added 3 scenes to our slides and had an example of the theme of our game being
based around college struggles. There are scenes of a person with pencil trying to fight off midterms and finals. In another scene
you have a weapon to fight off the sleep paralysis demons to stay awake for class. The last scene had hands and a tie to simulate an
employer asking questions during an interview, and the player is equipped with a resume. The audio assets were made with what we had
on hand, so Abe wrote on a notebook for a pencil sound, and he hit a spoon against the mug to make a metal clanging sound. The image assets
were the scenes themselves where we created our creation in paint and photoshop. For the shapes we used the google slides shape tools, in
order to make a cool logo for our studio. As for the logotype text, we used google drawings to get the logo text. I made the multi-line text 
block that was said by the interviewer boss, asking questions that you always hear at an interview. There is a fading animation after the first slide.
For the motion, I added an animation that makes the text for our logo come in from the left side.
